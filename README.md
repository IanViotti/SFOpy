# SFOpy

SFOpy is a research toolkit that implements Sunflower Optimization (SFO) algorithm in Python. The goal with this project is to implement this algorithm in a way that it's extensive while being extensible. 

- **Open-Source**: MIT License
- **Python version**: 3.6 and above.

## Note

This project is under development and not ready for use.

--- 
## Features

- Single objective SFO algorithm

--- 
## Installation 

To install this module, it's necessary to clone it with git as it's not uploaded do Pypi

---
## Basic Usage

To be implemented.

## Credits
